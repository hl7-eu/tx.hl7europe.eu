To run it, the preferred way is to run sudo docker-compose up --pull to pull the container image and start the server. Alternatively, pull the images with sudo docker compose pull and then start with sudo docker compose up. The start cycle of the server is: When the binary is launched, the server looks for the defined configuration location where the config.ini file is located. It then loads the configuration from the location indicated in that config.ini file. This configuration includes server parameters, ports, endpoitns, etc, as well as the content that should be loaded to the server. After loading the configuration and checking if all required content is present, it loading the packages and cache. After this, it starts the web server. After the web server is up, the server still runs a background loading process to fetch and index the content. Some time after launching the executable (configured in the docker-compose.yml file) the health check starts periodically checking if the server is responding.
